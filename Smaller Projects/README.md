# Smaller Projects

clustering_customer_segmentation_ml
--------------
The datasets provide information on marketing newsletters/e-mail campaigns (sent to customers) and transactions (purchases). This exercise uses several clustering approaches to try to learn more about customer behavior and find a way to group similar minded customers together.

data_wrangling_json
--------------
Work on JSON based data exercises.

hospital_readmissions_eda
--------------
Reduce Hospital Readmissions Using EDA. Critique a preliminary analysis of data and recommendations for reducing the readmissions rate. Construct a statistically sound analysis and provide recommendations.

human_body_temperature_eda
--------------
Analyze a dataset of human body temperatures and employ the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance.

linear_regression_boston_housing_ml
--------------
On the famous Boston Housing dataset, EDA and linear regression are extensively used to analyse the data, find positive correlations between variables, evaluate histograms, create regression models, evaluate those models, detect outliers and make a few predictions.

logistic_regression_heights_weights_ml
--------------
This is another exercise based on [Harvard CS 109: Data Science](https://github.com/cs109/2015lab5). The dataset provides heights and weights (of males and females) for practice, including tasks related to splitting the data into train & test sets, creating logistic regression models, fine tuning hyper-parameters, and evaluating model performance.

mode_analytics_sql_case_study
--------------
An SQL exercise done on the [Mode Analytics platform](https://modeanalytics.com/). The exercises investigate several SQL tables that contain information on user activity on a certain website. The aim is to identify the possible causes for the sudden decrease in user activity.

racial_discrimination_eda
--------------
Examine Racial Discrimination Using EDA. Perform statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.
