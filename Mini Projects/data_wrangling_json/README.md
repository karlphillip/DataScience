# data_wrangling_json
This project was developed in Python 3.x and requires Jupyter Notebooks, pandas, numpy, json and matplotlib to run.
The exercises require analysis to be performed on *World Bank Projects* data. 

In summary, the following activities can be observed in my solution:
- Normalization of the JSON data into a flat table;
- Data cleaning procedures (fill missing values, data type conversion);
- DataFrame operations (creation, sorting, concatenating);
- Manipulation of lists and dictionaries;
- Plotting with matplotlib;

All the datasets used are available under the **data** directory.
