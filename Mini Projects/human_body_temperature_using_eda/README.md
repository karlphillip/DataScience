# human_body_temperature_using_eda
This project was developed in Python 3.x and requires Jupyter Notebooks, pandas, numpy, json and matplotlib to run.
The exercises require analysis to be performed on data from *American Statistical Association (AMSTAT*. 

**What is the True Normal Human Body Temperature?**
The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37 C or 98.6 F for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. But, is this value statistically correct?

All the datasets used are available under the **data** directory.
